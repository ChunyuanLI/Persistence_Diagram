% Input 
% X: data
% S: similarity constraints (in the form of a pairwise-similarity matrix)
% D: disimilarity constraints (in the form of a pairwise-disimilarity matrix)
% A: initial distance metric matrix
% w: a weight vector originated from similar data (see paper)
% upper bound of constraint C1 (the sum of pairwise distance bound)
% maxiter: maximum iterations

% Output
% A: the solution of distance metric matrix
